## Backoff Retry

Both elections and voter-info have a version that can be called to get backoff retry
mechanics. In these cases, if the initial call returns either a server error or a 403
error with one of several reasons that indicate a temporary rate limit has been exceeded,
it will retry the call. You provide a retry-limit (the maximum number of retries, so total
calls could be retry-limit + 1), and a backoff function, with which you should pause
processing for as long as you deem appropriate.

```clojure
(voter-info "YOUR API KEY" "123 Main St Denver CO 80218" nil 10 #(Thread/sleep 1000))
```
